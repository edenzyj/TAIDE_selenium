In the environment, the propagation of the COLLETOTRICHUM bacteria is mainly affected by a variety of factors. In the nonsense generation, the bacteria can survive in the field, mainly based on conidonal spores as the source of infection. Both raw spores and subcost spores can be used as communication mediums. In addition, germs can spread through air and rain, and spread to other plants from the diseased tissue that are exposed to or falling in the soil by plant tissue. , Can resist the harsh environment, it will be recovered after the right high temperature, high and humidity conditions,

For the task, the following is a unified answer: In a high temperature and humid environment, and the subtropical climate in Taiwan, especially the strong rainfall caused by high temperature, high humidity and climate change, are all conducive to Taiwan's "anthracnlaxia "Diseases" occurred, under the right high temperature and humidity conditions, anthracnose is more likely to spread in tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, anthracnose is more likely to occur in a warm and humid environment.

In terms of different Colletotrichum SPPs, the following methods can be used to evaluate the aggressiveness of strawberries: 1. The desacide leaf bioAssay: This is an effective method for evaluating the prevention of dark spots of lactic acid bacteria to prevent dark spots. The effect of the cabbage of the cabbage is used for experiments to observe the prevention and control effect of E. coli. As a result, it shows that the method helps to understand the aggressiveness of different ColletOTRICHUM SPPs, 2. Use the mango anthuria
