Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberries. It is mainly caused by the plant fungal pathogenic in the Colletotrichum. The primary bacteria can harm the various parts of the strawberry, especially the infection of the crown department may cause plant death. The infection of fruit may lead to the serious impact of commodity value and yield. Antaqibang is the annual disease, which is mainly harmful to the whole plant of strawberry. serious,

1. The bacteria mainly invade the young and tender parts of the lemon fruit, and it may also enter the mature tissue through the wound. 2. After the fungal infection of the Phalaenopsis, the small water -like spots on the leaves first appear on the leaves. The yellow spots and the yellow spore pile on the back, 4. The lesions gradually expand, the color is gradually deeper, and the red -hearted rotten red in the later period.

In the environment, the propagation of the COLLETOTRICHUM bacteria is mainly affected by a variety of factors. In the nonsense generation, the bacteria can survive in the field, mainly based on conidonal spores as the source of infection. Both raw spores and subcost spores can be used as communication mediums. In addition, germs can spread through air and rain, and spread to other plants from the diseased tissue that are exposed to or falling in the soil by plant tissue. , Can resist the harsh environment, it will be recovered after the right high temperature, high and humidity conditions,

The symptoms of small berries suffer from black rot are mainly manifested in young tender tissues. For example, young leaves, red spots will be produced in the early stage of infection. Over time, these spots will gradually expand and become brown. The lesions may be possible. The fusion of each other causes the appearance of the overall blade to be damaged.

For the task, the following is a unified answer: In a high temperature and humid environment, and the subtropical climate in Taiwan, especially the strong rainfall caused by high temperature, high humidity and climate change, are all conducive to Taiwan's "anthracnlaxia "Diseases" occurred, under the right high temperature and humidity conditions, anthracnose is more likely to spread in tropical and subtropical regions. Therefore, anthracnose is more likely to occur in a warm and humid environment.

In terms of different Colletotrichum SPPs, the following methods can be used to evaluate the aggressiveness of strawberries: 1. The desacide leaf bioAssay: This is an effective method for evaluating the prevention of dark spots of lactic acid bacteria to prevent dark spots. The effect of the cabbage of the cabbage is used for experiments to observe the prevention and control effect of E. coli. As a result, it shows that the method helps to understand the aggressiveness of different ColletOTRICHUM SPPs, 2. Use the mango anthuria

In Taiwan, strawberry anthracnose is mainly caused by the Colletotrichum Gloeosports Species Complex (CGSC) and Botrytis Cinerea. These two types of germs are easily spread in continuous harvesting and affect all stages of strawberry planting. It is more difficult to control the disease during the seedling period. The main disease is anthracnose. Strawberry anthracnose can endanger the fruit and the plant of the plant. It is particularly serious in low -temperature areas. It may be seen in the gardening cultivation area in Taiwan. At present, in the management of pests in the fields, chemical prevention and treatment are still mainly based on

Temperature has an important impact on the spread and severity of Anthracnose of Strawberry. The two main decisive factors are temperature and humidity. These factors have a decisive effect on the survival and reproduction of Microdochium Nivale. Under environmental conditions, these fungi will spread quickly and cause severe strawberry damage. Therefore, understanding and management temperature and humidity are the key to preventing and controlling strawberry black rot.

Correct and fast diagnosis and identification of new Colletotrichum species are vital to disease management, which helps provide effective prevention and treatment measures and reduce losses. Applying evolutionary classification systems and gene sequence analysis can improve diagnosis efficiency, and study disease prevention strategies. Harm is harmful. The correct diagnosis of organisms is important to ensure agricultural production and reduce pesticide use. In addition, the relevant information of climate change is of great significance to monitoring pests and pests in order to take appropriate measures.
